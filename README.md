# Valence-Image-Classifier
This notebook was written by Zach Monge and is for creating an image classifier that can detect if an image is of a valence type positive, negative or neural. This script is for a supplementary analysis for the manuscript *Age-related differences in memory representational networks* authored by Zachary A. Monge, Maureen Ritchey, and Roberto Cabeza.

This notebook was ran in Google Colab and, therefore, parts of the script are specific to running the notebook in Colab.
